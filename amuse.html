    <h2>Vines</h2>
    <p> When I think of funny videos on the web, this is usually the first one that comes to mind.  Everyone that I knew growing up thought vine was hilarious and this is one of the key videos I remember from that era!  To save you time, this link should skip straight to where the funniness starts in the video</p>

    <h2> Entertainment for down time</h2>
    <p> During my down time I watch this show with my girlfriend over a competition of tattoo artist. I find super interesting how great and how some not-so-great tattoos come out of the artists.  </p>

    <h2> Free time watches </h2>
    <p>During my down time I watch the office because sometimes dry humor is the best humor. </p>
