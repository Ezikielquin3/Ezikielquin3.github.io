      What ispires me is when someone breaks the standards and the norms. I choose the first minority president as my role model 
    </p>
    <p>
      The people that are loved the most are the those who reprenstent the ones with the least amount of voice. Break standards and inspire others to belive they can.
    </p>
    <ul>
        		<li>Prideful- express there passion for there ideals </li>
        		<li>Motivate others - people follow a great leader and layout the blueprint for success </li>
        		<li>Are Visionaries- See a bigger picture for the future </li>
        		<li>Organized and well spoken - their impact is thought out and expressed diligently </li>
        		<li>Stay true to their roots - they live true to their calling while rembering their upbrining </li>
    		</ul>
    	<p>
        Over the last 10 years no man exemplifies these values for me more than Barack Obama. He inspired people of this country that are minorities that you can reach great feats. While providing a voice to those not only without one but inspire the next generation to follow in suit and accomplish their goals and dreams.
